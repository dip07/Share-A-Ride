 * 
 * This is meant to be a system-wide singleton which keeps track of service implementations (each also a singleton). 
 *  
 *  Usage: 
 *  
 *     // at application or test startup 
 *     ServiceRegistry registry = ServiceRegistry.getInstance();
 *     registry.register(MyInterface.class, new MyInterfaceImpl());
 *     
 *     // register other services ...
 *     
 *     // in code which needs to use a service
 *     
 *     
 *     MyInterface service = ServiceRegistry.getInstance(MyInterface.class);
 *     service.doWhatever(); 
 *     
 *   Note: if the registry is to accomplish the intended decoupling between business logic
 *   and knowledge of concrete service implementations, you MUST use only the interface (here "MyInterface") as the 
 *   registration key and as the type of the variable holding the returned reference. Otherwise you will have code
 *   that knows too much about where it is running to be testable both with Mocks and with production components. 
 *    
 *   One of the implications of this design is that at an particular time,
 *   you may only have one implementation of any registered service.
